* interceptor should have a marker that says it is on a line
* config to change ground height
* shouldnt be usable below Y = ?

* bugged temporal key shows in handbook
* key isnt broadcast properly to other clients


* the key looks like a temporal gear, should change that
* the inventory should have a gear slot placeholder

* interceptor still intercepts if covered
* transport still intercepts if covered
* charges dont go down for viewing clients
* sound should be farther
* malefactor and clockmakers will have a cheap recipe for the interceptor and transporter / not overlapping
